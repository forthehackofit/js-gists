appStorage
========

A very easy way to save and retrieve items in Local or Session Storage, you can store single items or multiple items at a time since it will stringify objects
when it encouters it.
<p>
This assumes that the Storage object is present in the window, for a support on older browsers I highly recommend combining this and wojodesign solution as a polyfill
